## Completed Games
### [Umineko When They Cry](https://umineko-project.org/en/)
(TODO: Image)

I've been playing _Umineko_ since well before I made the resolution to review every game I played this year - according to Steam, I finished the first chapter in March of last year - and for the entire length of this project I have been _dreading_ writing this review. On one hand, it's so stuffed with surprises, subversions, and twists that even talking about the second of its eight chapters would feel like spoiling it[^1]. On the other, VNDB claims it's 145 hours long in total, so no one's going to listen to me if I just tell them to play it and leave it at that[^2]. So I'll be as general as I can in this mini-review, and maybe follow it up with a meatier post later if I have the time.

I started _Umineko_ as part of my endless crusade to play **EVERY MYSTERY GAME EVER**, in the hopes of better informing the mechanics in _Hunchback_. Since _Umineko_ is a kinetic novel[^3], I didn't think I'd get much out of it in this regard, and I'd picked it up mostly on its aesthetic and Internet presence. As it turns out, however, despite having no traditional gameplay whatsoever, _Umineko_ is still one of the most mechanically interesting mystery games I've played, simply by virtue of how its story is structured and presented to the player. The author, Ryukishi07, is keenly aware of the limitations of his chosen medium, and comes up with ingenious ways of both presenting and obfuscating the facts of the matter in ways that are fun, fresh, and fair. I spent a long, long time taking notes on this game, and I did it because I felt like I was being invited to. If there's one thing I want to stress in this review, it's that _Umineko_ _wants_ to involve you. It _wants_ to be solved. Even if it really, _really_ doesn't seem like it.

Did I solve it? No. Could I have solved it, if I were smarter and more willing to retread every scene to see how it matched up with my assumptions? Probably still no, honestly. _Umineko_'s confident enough to not spell itself out for you, even at the very end, but the answers it does give ended up feeling a little silly for me, and require interpreting some clues in very specific ways[^4]. But this is where the greatest surprise of _Umineko_ lies for me: even after spending well over a hundred hours trying to solve the ultimate puzzle-box mystery and feeling a little underwhelmed by its solution... _I don't care_. I'm still recommending this. Because everything _Umineko_ accomplishes as a mystery unto itself is only the tip of the iceberg.

Multiple characters in _Umineko_ are mystery buffs to varying degrees, and when they're not wrapped up in trying not to die themselves, they do a lot of musing on mysteries in general. They do this from the inside perspective, as characters actually stuck in a puzzle-box mystery who have to analyze and outmaneuver their unknown enemy; they do it from a technical perspective, discussing the classic Knox and van Dine rules and trying to determine what makes a mystery fair or fun; they do it from a thematic perspective, asking what kinds of people gravitate to the genre and why; they do it from a moral perspective, wondering what kind of mindset the fascination instills and what happens when that intersects with reality. All this is interspersed with excellent character writing on more conventional levels, and I'm very impressed by how often characters can oscillate between "utterly reprehensible scumbag" and "ultimate badass hero" while still feeling like the same people throughout.

I've mused before about how properties with infamously monolithic time investments (e.g. _Homestuck_, _Fate_, uh... any RPG) tend to garner the most obsessive fans, since anyone not amenable to that mindset would filter out partway through, and how you have to take that into account when considering their recommendations. Now I'm seeing that from the other side[^5], and doing my best not to oversell this game while the "honeymoon" feeling is still fresh. But even so, I'm damn sure it's going to wind up in my top 5. _Umineko_ has made me a better mystery writer, and I think it might have even made me a better person. There is nothing else like it. Please play it[^6].

### [The Space Between](https://chrstphfr.itch.io/the-space-between)

Back in the summer of 2020, itch.io hosted the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) in support of the Black Lives Matter protests. Anyone who purchased this gained access to a total of 1,741 titles; and while this did include well-known indie darlings like _Celeste_ and _Night in the Woods_, I was more interested by the stuff I'd never heard of before. So a few friends and I started the Video Game Book Club, where every month we'd all play a game none of us had touched before and see what was up with it. After a short hiatus, we're back this month, and this month's game is _The Space Between_[^7].

_The Space Between_ is a short, surreal, horror-ish title that, like a lot of stuff on itch.io these days, leans into the "haunted PS1" aesthetic, taking advantage of low-res textures and color-distorting post-processing effects to make its whole world feel uncanny and alien. But here, the choice isn't just for nostalgia's sake: that barrier to immersion, that _separation_, needs to be there because _separation_ is the running theme here.

The game is mostly a character study of architect Martin Melanson, whose obsession with walls informs not only his career but also his relationship with equally poetic weirdo Clara. Despite the two being stilted in ways that would make any _Silent Hill_ blush, I still found some empathy for them. Martin spends a lifetime mastering the art of keeping people at a comfortable distance, then despairs when he finds himself inexorably drawn to the same intimacy he fears so much. I think anyone can relate to this dissonance, even if they don't take it to "having sex through a sheet" levels.

_The Space Between_ will not be an engaging game to many people. Even within the arthouse walking sim sphere, it's rather unapproachable. Dialogue is excruciatingly slow, hanging for ten seconds even on lines as short as "Yes"; in two cases, the visual filters were so strong they prevented me from seeing what I needed to progress; and the writing is about as subtle as a foghorn. But for the VGBC, it was interesting enough to provoke a discussion longer than its runtime, and I think that's a pretty good recommendation. Plus, if you bought the bundle way back when, you already own it, so why not give it a shot?

[^1]: Hell, I'd avoid even telling you it _had_ eight chapters if I thought I could keep you away from that information.
[^2]: For the record, I think this is overshooting it. Steam lists me as having 75 hours in the first half (I switched over to the Umineko Project version for the second), which puts it right on target with the VNDB estimate, but I spent a decent chunk of that tabbing out to take notes, and I know I just left the game running while I did other stuff on several occasions.
[^3]: A term for a visual novel with no branching paths. Officially, the _When They Cry_ series is referred to as "sound novels", though I don't think there's a technical difference and VNDB also calls it a kinetic novel.
[^4]: Granted, my understanding of the earlier chapters has been eroded by time and is mostly informed by some admittedly terrible notes. Maybe the inevitable replay will enlighten me.
[^5]: Although, given my [previously established attention issues]({% post_url 2022-01-31-games-i-played-january-2022 %}), maybe the fact that I even _could_ give this one the requisite time investment is recommendation enough.
[^6]: The link in the title goes to the fan-made _Umineko Project_, which lumps together the best parts of the PC and PS3 versions of the game. It's locked behind a password as an anti-piracy hack, and while I won't post it here it's not too hard to find. Obviously, if you end up liking it you should support it. I own the Steam versions of both halves, myself. I played the first half on Steam using [07th-Mod](https://07th-mod.com/home/), which is good enough if you don't want to tangle with the grey area of quasi-piracy.
[^7]: We also picked _Exo One_, but I played that last year and don't remember it well enough to review.
