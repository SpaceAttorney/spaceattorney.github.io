Welcome back to another monthly roundup!

## Completed Games
### [Strange Horticulture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/)

Something about this game makes me feel like I want to coin a new subgenre. It reminds me a lot of [_VA-11 HALL-A_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/) in the sense that customers show up, give you an order with a varying amount of ambiguity, and it's up to you to give them what they want. "Customer service puzzler", maybe? But the screen layout and general "listen to person, compare with known data" loop also remind me of [_Papers, Please_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/) and its progeny, which are basically the polar opposite of customer service. I'll put a pin in this because I doubt we've seen the end of this trend.

But enough about that. How's the game itself? Well, much like _VA-11 HALL-A_ I came away wishing it had done more with the puzzley implications of its mechanics. There is a fun source of puzzles in the cards you get every morning, which give increasingly abstract hints to a location on the map where you can harvest additional plants, and there are some miscellaneous riddles sprinkled throughout the story that I enjoyed. However, the central pillar of the game, customers coming in to ask you for plants, is almost always maximally straightforward - usually outright telling you what plant to grab and requiring only the effort to identify it in your ever-growing collection from one or two details. You acquire an impressive variety of plants over the course of the campaign, and while obsessively tagging and sorting them as they came in was fun for me by itself, I would have felt much more justified in that work if it had actually been tested.

The aesthetic does a lot to lift the experience (if you're into it, anyway). Small details, like the changing weather being visible through your windows, give the shop an appropriately eerie-but-cozy atmosphere, and while the story doesn't plumb the dark depths of eldritch madness in the same way, say, [_Cultist Simulator_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator/) does, it was eventful enough that I went through the whole 4-5-hour adventure in a single sitting. There are multiple endings, but the differences between them boil down to a handful of pretty obvious binary choices, and I didn't feel compelled to try out any more than the one I naturally got.

Verdict: If you're into the aesthetic, go for it, especially if you *want* to be into the aesthetic but don't care for the magnitude of horror that it usually implies. The puzzles and story are simple but still immersive enough to make for an enjoyable evening.

### [Death's Door](https://store.steampowered.com/app/894020/Deaths_Door/)

When I came away from [_Unsighted_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062110/UNSIGHTED/) late last year, I remember thinking "Man, I could just keep playing isometric action games _forever_". So although _Death's Door_ had slipped my radar for a while for whatever reason, once it popped into my periphery I figured I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't give it a shot. And it, uh, kind of immediately broke me out of that mindset.

This is the kind of game that I really don't know how to review, especially without feeling bad. I can't point to much that I think it does *wrong* on any level, and I would probably recommend it to anyone who thinks it looks good. But I can't deny that I probably wouldn't have seen it through if not for the "finish or drop" mentality I [promised to develop]({% post_url 2022-01-31-games-i-played-january-2022 %}) at the start of the year. Though, at the same time, I did ultimately choose the "finish" half of that, so I must have liked it a little.

First: the gameplay. I think one of the main reasons I bounced off this game initially is the pace of its fights, which can feel sluggish coming off of the likes of _Unsighted_, _CrossCode_, or _Hyper Light Drifter_. Though the basic speed improves as you acquire upgrades, I don't think it reaches the heights of gamefeel as its contemporaries (a high bar to clear, to be fair), mostly owing to most enemies' unwillingness to react to any attack that didn't kill them. The game also has a weird way of handling weight, which I think delayed my ability to come up with a workable and fun strategy[^1].

From an aesthetic perspective, the game does a fair bit better. I'm always a fan of the soft-shaded, almost clay-like on display here - I think it's a great way to achieve a production-friendly minimalism while still maintaining good immersion. Add in the muted color palette and you have a perfect look for a moody fantasy game about restoring mortality to a cartoon purgatory. Unfortunately, the actual tone of the game doesn't match up. This is a game where an NPC delivers a somber eulogy for each boss you defeat, but it's also a game where your player character throws away their chopsticks to dive head-first into a soup prepared by a squid unconvincingly puppeting around a corpse. Also, the NPC delivering the eulogy is named "Steadhone". It's not that I think the creepy-cute aesthetic _can't_ work - _Hollow Knight_ manages to be both funnier _and_ darker than this at points - but something about the world of _Death's Door_ just didn't click for me, and I found it hard to take it seriously when it needed me to.

All that said, I am working through the post-game as I write this, so even though I have reservations about it and would definitely recommend playing the other games I've mentioned first, there's clearly _something_ here. The post-game in particular is pretty cool so far, although I doubt it'll inspire me to edit this entry when I wrap it up.

[^1]: Basically, "heavier" weapons have less swings per combo, but the actual speeds of the swing animations hardly vary between weapons. The fastest weapon, a set of twin knives, does the most DPS, but that only matters if you have enough time between enemy attacks to get the full combo in. So I ended up using the heavy hammer for common rabble and the knives for bosses, which is the opposite of how I handle most action games. YMMV on how much this affects you, I guess.
