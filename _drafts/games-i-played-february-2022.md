Welcome back to another roundup! I couldn't even make two in a row, wow! But fret not, dear reader: though I may have slacked on reviewing games, I in no way slacked on playing them. For those curious, the same holds true for _Hunchback_: I've been pretty hard at work on it, and once I reach my next goal I'll welcome the chance to switch gears and write a devblog about it. Stay tuned. For now, games!

## Completed Games
### [Strange Horticulture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/)
![Strange Horticulture promo image](strange.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

Something about this game makes me feel like I want to coin a new subgenre. It reminds me a lot of [_VA-11 HALL-A_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/447530/VA11_HallA_Cyberpunk_Bartender_Action/) in the sense that customers show up, give you an order with a varying amount of ambiguity, and it's up to you to give them what they want. "Customer service puzzler", maybe? But the screen layout and general "listen to person, compare with known data" loop also remind me of [_Papers, Please_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/) and its progeny, which are basically the polar opposite of customer service. I'll put a pin in this because I doubt we've seen the end of this trend.

But enough about that. How's the game itself? Well, much like _VA-11 HALL-A_ I came away wishing it had done more with the puzzley implications of its mechanics. There is a fun source of puzzles in the cards you get every morning, which give increasingly abstract hints to a location on the map where you can harvest additional plants, and there are some miscellaneous riddles sprinkled throughout the story that I enjoyed. However, the central pillar of the game, customers coming in to ask you for plants, is almost always maximally straightforward - usually outright telling you what plant to grab and requiring only the effort to identify it in your ever-growing collection from one or two details. You acquire an impressive variety of plants over the course of the campaign, and while obsessively tagging and sorting them as they came in was fun for me by itself, I would have felt much more justified in that work if it had actually been tested.

The aesthetic does a lot to lift the experience (if you're into it, anyway). Small details, like the changing weather being visible through your windows, give the shop an appropriately eerie-but-cozy atmosphere, and while the story doesn't plumb the dark depths of eldritch madness in the same way, say, [_Cultist Simulator_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/718670/Cultist_Simulator/) does, it was eventful enough that I went through the whole 4-5-hour adventure in a single sitting. There are multiple endings, but the differences between them boil down to a handful of pretty obvious binary choices, and I didn't feel compelled to try out any more than the one I naturally got.

Verdict: If you're into the aesthetic, go for it, especially if you *want* to be into the aesthetic but don't care for the magnitude of horror that it usually implies. The puzzles and story are simple but still immersive enough to make for an enjoyable evening.

### [Death's Door](https://store.steampowered.com/app/894020/Deaths_Door/)
![Death's Door promo image](death.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

When I came away from [_Unsighted_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062110/UNSIGHTED/) late last year, I remember thinking "Man, I could just keep playing isometric action games _forever_". So although _Death's Door_ had slipped my radar for a while for whatever reason, once it popped into my periphery I figured I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't give it a shot. And it, uh, kind of immediately broke me out of that mindset.

This is the kind of game that I really don't know how to review, especially without feeling bad. I can't point to much that I think it does *wrong* on any level, and I would probably recommend it to anyone who thinks it looks good. But I can't deny that I probably wouldn't have seen it through if not for the "finish or drop" mentality I [promised to develop]({% post_url 2022-01-31-games-i-played-january-2022 %}) at the start of the year. Though, at the same time, I did ultimately choose the "finish" half of that, so I must have liked it a little.

First: the gameplay. I think one of the main reasons I bounced off this game initially is the pace of its fights, which can feel sluggish coming off of the likes of _Unsighted_, _CrossCode_, or _Hyper Light Drifter_. Though the basic speed improves as you acquire upgrades, I don't think it reaches the heights of gamefeel as its contemporaries (a high bar to clear, to be fair), mostly owing to most enemies' unwillingness to react to any attack that doesn't kill them. The game also has a weird way of handling weight, which I think delayed my ability to come up with a workable and fun strategy[^1].

From an aesthetic perspective, the game does a fair bit better. I'm always a fan of the soft-shaded, almost clay-like style on display here - I think it's a great way to achieve a production-friendly minimalism while still maintaining good immersion. Add in the muted color palette and you have a perfect look for a moody fantasy game about restoring mortality to a cartoon purgatory. Unfortunately, the actual tone of the game doesn't match up. This is a game where an NPC delivers a somber eulogy for each boss you defeat, but it's also a game where your player character throws away their chopsticks to dive head-first into a soup prepared by a squid unconvincingly puppeting around a corpse. Also, the NPC delivering the eulogy is named "Steadhone". It's not that I think the creepy-cute aesthetic _can't_ work - _Hollow Knight_ manages to be both funnier _and_ darker than this at points - but something about the world of _Death's Door_ just didn't click for me, and I found it hard to take it seriously when it needed me to.

All that said, I am working through the post-game as I write this, so even though I have reservations about it and would definitely recommend playing the other games I've mentioned first, there's clearly _something_ here. The post-game in particular is pretty cool so far, although I doubt it'll inspire me to edit this entry when I wrap it up.

### [Elden Ring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/)
(note: put a screenshot of your dumb character here)

The reason I didn't have this post up at the end of February is that I was on vacation for the last week of the month and couldn't get around to it. The reason I didn't have this post up at the end of March is that I was still too busy playing _Elden Ring_.

I'll keep the review short, because it's the biggest game in forever and I imagine you already know everything you need to about it (also because I'm several reviews behind). _Elden Ring_ is a gigantic game, and every square foot of it feels like it belongs there. It is _Breath of The Wild_, except every little orb that counts as a fourth of a heart container is replaced with either a pendant that boosts your fire defense, or a headless ghost that you can summon in combat, or a sword that shoots lasers of flaming blood. It is _Dark Souls_, _Bloodborne_, and _Sekiro_, mixed into a fine powder and crop-dusted over an area bigger than all of them combined. It is a From Software title in which being a caster sounds _fun_, fun enough that even after the 120 hours it took to clear it the first time I'm itching to do it all over again but with lightning hands. It's good.

### [Tunic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/553420/TUNIC/)
![Tunic promo image](tunic.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

_Tunic_ is like Zelda. More specifically, it's like your first Zelda game, the one you played at three years old when you could barely read, let alone understand anything that was going on. When you could load up your older brother's 100% complete save file, wander around for a bit, maybe figure out how an item or two worked, and then somehow get trapped in a scary new area with no idea how you got there or how to get out, and looking back on it twenty years later you realize, with confusion, that the formative and traumatic moment you are recollecting wasn't actually in the game at all.

Okay, maybe it's not _all_ of that. But I feel that's definitely what it's going for. The game's core conceit is that its instruction manual is both (A) torn up and scattered throughout the game world and (B) written almost completely in an alien language. From the manual's pictographs and the small snippets of English you can find, you must puzzle out how to traverse this world and, ultimately, how to overcome it. The puzzles aren't just puzzles, here; they're integrated into the world on a fundamental level, and that makes discovering the solutions to these puzzles feel much deeper, like you aren't just learning a system but _uncovering a secret_. I think this kind of synthesis is a big part of the reason games like _The Witness_ and _Outer Wilds_ garner so much acclaim, and I think the comparison here is apt.

However, unlike those games, _Tunic_ is also a hack-and-slash; it is very obviously _Zelda_-inspired, after all. On this axis, I don't think it fares as well. It tries to bring in some _Souls_-y mechanics to liven up the combat (hello, corpse run!) but doesn't have the feedback or depth to make the difficulty spikes tolerable. The shield is the worst offender here, as there's a small but infinitely aggravating window where your little fox guy visibly has his shield up but the game hasn't yet decided that you're actually blocking. And that's to say nothing of the part where the game decides the best way to up the difficulty is to remove all the upgrades you've spent so long acquiring. But if you really like the style of puzzle I've described, I'd say it's ultimately worth a play.

### [NORCO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/)
![NORCO promo image](norco.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

Southern Gothic _and_ androids? I'm not sure there's a simpler way to describe _NORCO_'s genre than "extremely my shit", and, true to form, I quite liked my time with this game. Its marriage of anti-capitalist cynicism, nightmare Christianity, and internet meme humor gave me a constant feeling that the game was punching far above its weight, that it shouldn't be working at all - and yet it comes damn close to nailing all of it. At its worst, _NORCO_ hides in the shadow of its most obvious inspirations: The UI is _Disco Elysium_'s, and a few scenes shift their visual and gameplay frames around in ways that mostly say "Hey, _Kentucky Route Zero_ was pretty cool, wasn't it?" But of course those are two of the greatest games ever made, and it's hard to fault anybody too much for being inspired by them. And at its best, the game is downright arresting - a surreal, mythical landscape in equal parts past, present, and future.

## Dropped Games
### [Unexplored](https://store.steampowered.com/app/506870/Unexplored/)
![Unexplored promo image](unexplored.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

I picked this up after hearing some buzz about the sequel from some gaming personalities I heavily trust. As they tell it, _Unexplored_ has some of the most advanced level generation of any roguelike, weaving organic puzzles into its myriad caves in a way that feels like the deliberate hand of an artist. And I'm not going to argue with that, I suppose: I mostly enjoy the rogue-_lite_ side of things, and those are usually just pre-made rooms stitched together. But however impressive the technology on display here may or may not be, it wasn't enough to keep me hooked. If I really wanted a traditional dungeon-crawling experience, I have plenty in my backlog that actually _are_ made by the deliberate hand of an artist. The sequel still looks cool, though.

### [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/)
![HZD promo image](horizon.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

I'd been looking to play this for a while, ever since I got my hands on a PS5, and finally pulled the trigger on it when I saw an e-mail saying that, if I beat it before the sequel came out, I'd be entered in a sweepstakes to get the sequel for free. I liked the idea of this contest, since it kind of killed two birds with one stone for me: if I beat the game, I got to knock it off my backlog and get a contest entry to boot. If I didn't, then that would serve as a useful signal that I could ignore the sequel, as clearly I wouldn't be willing to put much time into that either. Turns out, it was the second one.

I want to stress here that I actually enjoyed _Horizon_ a fair amount - it's gorgeous, for one thing, and the focus on hunting and scavenging takes a lot of bog-standard open-world design tropes (mostly crafting) and makes them feel justified and even fresh. It felt bad to drop - so did _Unexplored_ - but that's the whole _raison d'etre_ of this project, isn't it? There are too many good games to play, so I have to drop some. Them's the breaks.

(although i heard forbidden west has gyro aim so i am morally obligated to get it anyway)

[^1]: Basically, "heavier" weapons have less swings per combo, but the actual speeds of the swing animations hardly vary between weapons. The fastest weapon, a set of twin knives, does the most DPS, but that only matters if you have enough time between enemy attacks to get the full combo in. So I ended up using the heavy hammer for common rabble and the knives for bosses, which is the opposite of how I handle most action games. YMMV on how much this affects you, I guess.
