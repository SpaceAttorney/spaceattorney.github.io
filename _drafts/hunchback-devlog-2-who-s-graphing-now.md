Hello again! [Last time]({% post_url 2022-02-09-hunchback-devlog-1-the-old-to-the-new %}) on the devblog, I mentioned I'd be moving on to menu design. And, while I did do that, I quickly got sucked into a side distraction for about a month, so I'll be devoting this entry to that instead. And so it goes.

## What Happened?
I started by working on the main pause menu, the one that pops up when you press the Menu key in the overworld. I still plan on giving the menu design and code its own post later, but here it is:

![The main "office" menu](office.png){: w="842" h="470"}
_The main pause menu. I've been referring to this internally as the "office menu" due to its stylization, as "main menu" makes me think of the menu that would appear when you first boot the game._
