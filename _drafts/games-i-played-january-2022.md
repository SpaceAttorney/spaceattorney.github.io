I play a lot of video games every year, and I expect to play a lot in 2022 as well. But am I playing _enough_?

Never.

## Playing Games Better

I've posted [before]({% post_url 2022-01-29-hunchback-devlog-0-new-year-new-game %}) about how my ADD got in the way of getting proper _work_ done, both in college and with my game, but what really tipped me over the edge in terms of seeking treatment was when I noticed that it was affecting my _leisure_ time as well. I'd get really excited about a game, buy it, and pin it to the top of my backlog for later. Then a nice long block of free time would roll around, and... I'd go back to the same games I was already used to. Sometimes I wouldn't play games at all, just mindlessly switch between Chrome tabs until I ran out of time. And the thought that ran through my mind, every time I stared longingly at the games I _wanted_ to play, games I _already owned_, was...

_"This deserves more attention than I can give it right now."_

The upshot of all this is that solving the work problem should give me a leg up on the other as well. Hence, my second resolution of 2022: **Play games better**. I'm operationalizing this as follows:
- **Keep track of what I'm playing.** In previous years, I would often start games, get into them, then paradoxically _stop_ playing them for the reasons outlined above. Eventually, when I had started too many, the decision paralysis on which to continue would throw me off even on my good days. I edit this draft throughout the month, so I can use it to keep a closer eye on how many games I consider myself playing at a time.
- **Drop games for real.** A sister problem to the above is that if I liked a game but hadn't played it in a while, it would acquire a weird state of half-dropped-ness that would demoralize me. Plus, the longer it went on, the more likely I'd be to want to start over instead of picking it back up (cf. Devblog 1). There are a few games that are constantly in the "maybe I'll finish it _this_ time" loop, and I want to minimize that. There are also a lot of games that I'll realize I don't like very much, but will punt to a third-tier backlog (yes i have three tiers of backlog) instead of dropping outright, either because people I respect like it and I feel I must be missing something, or because I'm just a sucker who doesn't like not liking things. So if I notice a game has been hanging around in the "In Progress" section for too long without me actually playing it, I'll know that's cause for a droppin'.
- **Engage.** Knowing I'll eventually be writing _something_ about every game I play will hopefully help me get into the mindset of thinking more about those games when I'm actually playing them.

So, now that that's all out of the way, what have I been playing this month?

## Completed Games
### [MYST (2021)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255560/Myst/)
![MYST (2021) promo image](myst_ship.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

I'm a pretty big fan of puzzley adventure games. When I was growing up, the genre was mostly kept afloat by Flash-based room escape games. I loved those, but they were pretty variable in quality, especially in the visuals. I'd seen bits and pieces of some older CD-ROM titles, like _The Crystal Key_ and _Safecracker_, as a toddler, and the stark, utilitarian look of the age (one very similar to the current "liminal spaces" trend, IMO) imprinted on me in the way random things tend to do when you're a toddler. I'd previously purchased _Myst: Masterpiece Edition_ and _realMYST_, neither of which ran on my computer, so when a more modern rerelease was announced I was quite excited. And now that I've finally got my hands on it, I can definitively state...

...that it kind of sucks, actually!

In my previous attempts to play _Myst_, I got just far enough before the game crashed to realize that the central island held gateways to four other locations. It had left me with the impression that everything I knew of the game was only the tip of the iceberg. As it turns out, though, each of the four secondary locations in the game contains literally one puzzle, and most of them are pretty simple. According to Steam, I beat the $30 game in just over four hours, and the engaging parts of that were a mere fraction of that runtime. This is because the puzzles are all _relentlessly_ drawn-out. Some, like the railway puzzle in the Mechanical Age, are clearly designed this way in an attempt to thwart would-be brute-forcers, but even once you figure out the correct solution, executing it still takes an obscene amount of time. Gamers in the '90s must have been _really_ patient if Cyan felt they had to go as far as they did to stymie them.

But other puzzles take all of the time with none of the cognitive load. In an early section, you have to obtain a set of passwords by manipulating a mechanism on one floor of a building that reveals a password on another. You have to do this four times, which means eight elevator rides that accomplish nothing except wasting your time. One of these passwords is a set of three dates, each specific from the year all the way down to the minute (another defense against brute force, I imagine). Since you'll be using these dates in a separate building, you'll have to have a physical notebook handy to write them all down in. Now, ordinarily, I'm all for games that require taking notes. I think it's quite fun. But it isn't exactly a viable strategy if you're, say, wearing a VR headset. Did I mention VR is, like, this remake's entire raison d'etre? OH WELL!

I love _Myst_'s design philosophy in theory - tactile machinery and puzzles that span entire areas - and I love the modern games that carry it forward (like [Quern](https://store.steampowered.com/app/512790/Quern__Undying_Thoughts/), [The Room](https://store.steampowered.com/app/288160/The_Room/), and Cyan's own [Obduction](https://store.steampowered.com/app/306760/Obduction/)). But I cannot recommend _MYST (2021)_ at its asking price. It is four hours long, contains eight puzzles, and its biggest new feature (VR) is fundamentally at odds with its core design. It might still be worth a play via Game Pass, though, if like me you've been a fan of the subgenre for a while without having played it yet.

### [I Expect You to Die 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1499120/I_Expect_You_To_Die_2/)
![I Expect You to Die 2 promo image](expect_2.png){: w="1920" h="1080"}

As a 3-hour and $25 room escape game, this would seem to be a similar value proposition to the _Myst_ remake, but I had a blast with this game, much as I did with its predecessor. The secret agent trappings are a great fit for the genre, and the level-based structure combined with the myriad silly ways to screw around and/or die make it a surprisingly fun game to watch others play as well. If you've played [the first one](https://store.steampowered.com/app/587430/I_Expect_You_To_Die/) already, "more of that" should be an easy sell. If not, start with that first - it's just as good, and will probably go on sale more often.

### [Moncage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1195290/Moncage/)
![Moncage promo image](moncage.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

_Moncage_ is an indie puzzle game taking place entirely on the faces of a cube. Each face is a window into a different 3D environment, and by looking at the cube from certain angles you can line up objects in two different areas until they appear (and behave) as one. The game gets a decent amount of mileage out of this premise and doesn't outstay its welcome, though in the later stages things got a bit complicated and I used the hint feature a bit more than I'd readily admit. A good, casual game to pick up in a sale and spend a sitting with.

### [Returnal](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/returnal/)
![Returnal promo image](returnal.png){: w="1920" h="1080"}

I wasn't sure what I expected from _Returnal_ going in; I picked it up mostly because I'd just finished showing a friend the platformer that comes pre-installed on the PS5 and I was hungry for another title that actually used all the crazy tech shoved into its controller. The roguelite action game is a genre that's only at its best when it's going tough on you, and I didn't expect one of the PS5's few flagship titles to be willing to shoulder the market risk that difficulty entails.

No need to fear, however: _Returnal_ kicked my ass from start to finish. No matter how much extra health you can scrounge up, one bad encounter can knock you from full health to death's door in a flash. Runs also go quite long relative to its contemporaries, as individual encounters almost always take several minutes to clear. Entrances to new areas appear early in each map, but the key or powerup that opens them is found at the end. In this way, you can _technically_ shave time off your run by skipping most of an area you've already cleared, but in practice this means giving up items and health upgrades that are practically essential for survival. I've seen other roguelites offer shortcuts (e.g. _Spelunky_, _Enter the Gungeon_), but they're usually easy to ignore. With _Returnal_ I felt like I was _expected_ to use the shortcuts, but doing so was a death sentence almost every time.

Back when I was playing _Warframe_, I would pretty frequently hear complaints about the grindiness of it. And while I certainly couldn't argue on any _factual_ grounds, I found it weird regardless because, for the most part, the actions you do to grind for a new weapon or frame are the same as the actions you'll be doing when you're done: going into missions, shooting people, flipping all over the walls. If it isn't fun now, why would you expect it to be fun later? I found myself taking the same mentality with _Returnal_, eventually. Re-clearing the old area when the new one is _right there_ does have a sting to it, but you can greatly ease that by just focusing on the moment-to-moment gameplay.

And that gameplay is _fantastic_. Every gun feels unique, and this is in large part due to the haptic and auditory reports they deliver through the DualSense controller. While there aren't a huge amount of weapons in the game (especially early - I think they could've stood to front-load the variety a bit more), each has a random set of modifiers it can pull from, so even the same weapon can feel different the next time you find it. Add to that the array of flashy alt-fire modes and consumable combat abilities and combat is pretty much always a whirlwind of dazzling lights and punchy sounds.

Now that I've seen credits roll, I don't know if I'll come back to Returnal. There's a possible secret ending (that I don't much care about - the story's pretty familiar once you dig through all the spooky abstracta), and I didn't have much time to play around with the last couple of unlockable weapons, but the run length makes it difficult to treat it as a casual "forever game" alongside my other favorites.

### [The Shivah](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252370/The_Shivah/)
![The Shivah promo image](shivah.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

This one is a short little point-and-click by Dave Gilbert of Wadjet Eye. Although I quite liked his other work, the _[Blackwell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/80330/The_Blackwell_Legacy/)_ series, I wasn't aware of the connection at first. I picked this up mostly because the idea of playing as a rabbi who could, at your discretion, talk solely in rhetorical questions gave me such strong _[Unsong](https://unsongbook.com/)_ vibes that I could not resist. I liked it, though it's a small enough game that I don't really have much to say about it.

### [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/)
![Vampire Survivors promo image](vampire.jpg){: w="1280" h="800" }

Well, insofar as one can "complete" a roguelite. Vampire Survivors is a simple top-down action game about collecting and leveling up a set of weapons and items in the hopes that you can scrounge up a tidal wave of bullets big enough to stand against literally tens of thousands of enemies. [As Northernlion puts it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xcNiaaAzB8), "it's pure dopamine."

There's not a lot of content to this right now, but at $3 there doesn't have to be. I look forward to seeing what kind of craziness ends up here.

## Dropped Games
### [Demon Turf](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325900/Demon_Turf/)
![Demon Turf promo image](demonturf.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

I feel like this game is 90% of the way to being serviceable and 60-70% of the way to being really good. The core platforming is solid and technical, with all kinds of combo jumps, spins, and dives to master. My biggest problem with it is just that it feels really slow, even after I got an item that increases your running speed, and that sinks the whole experience. Other aspects are hit or miss, and might suit you more than me depending on taste. The combat is a unique system where you have to push enemies into hazards before they can do the same to you, and while I never found it more fun than simply smacking things I didn't hate it either. The visual design and writing didn't have nearly the level of charm as current indie platformer king _[A Hat in Time](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253230/A_Hat_in_Time/)_, and I started skipping through text pretty early, though I did like the scribbly 2D/3D compositing and the blatantly _Splatoon_-ish soundtrack.

After a lot of waffling, I finally dropped it after clearing the first area, getting the hookshot, and realizing it was bad. It feels hardcoded, in the sense that you have to be in a very specific place to use it so it can launch you at a very specific trajectory, more akin to _Super Mario Galaxy_'s launch stars than an actual platforming tool. If you can't make a hookshot fun, you're doomed, buddy.

### [Bright Memory: Infinite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1178830/Bright_Memory_Infinite/)
![Bright Memory: Infinite promo image](brightmemory.jpg){: w="1920" h="1080"}

A character action/FPS hybrid and a testament to what even a single person can get done with the Unreal Engine. _Bright Memory_ gives you a lot of toys to play with in a short amount of time, but in that span it doesn't really give you the impetus to try them out or even the time to do so properly. Every enemy I encountered in my short playtime either died to two bursts from the default rifle or needed to be parried and launched into the air before they died to two bursts from the default rifle.

I dropped this mostly because a bug trapped me in one of the levels and I had to force quit, and since then I saw someone heavily recommending it, so I might break my rule at some point and give it another chance. I also might put more effort into customizing the controls now that I know what the spread of verbs is. The default parry key is Tab, for heaven's sake! Surely that is not the intended way to play.
