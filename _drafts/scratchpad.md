I mentioned before that "almost nothing" strikes the ideal balance of a mystery game in my experience. The best exception to this statement, IMO, is _Return of the Obra Dinn_, which is why it's my primary inspiration. For those who don't know, _Obra Dinn_ features sixty cases - one for each person on board the titular ship. For each case, you must match three things: their name, their cause of death, and the responsible party. The first is chosen from the ship's manifest; the other two are given specific drop-down menus with an exhaustive list of possible answers. Whenever you get three sets of three correct, those answers are locked in.

So what about this works so well? I think I can boil it down to two factors: _simplicity_ and _strictness_. The structure is _simple_ in the sense that, for each mystery, you only have to answer three questions, and that this is true regardless of the complexity of the puzzle behind them. It's understandable why games would want to squeeze more gameplay into each mystery (even the tangentially-related minigames in _Danganronpa_ and the _Sherlock Holmes_ games), but ultimately this tends to cash out to every piece of the puzzle needing to have some interactive element explicitly attached to it. Nothing is allowed to happen entirely in the player's head. Besides the clues themselves, _Obra Dinn_ doesn't have any of these goalposts connecting you from a question to its answer, but by the same merit it also doesn't have any obstacles _between_ those two. Your deductions feel like yours, and that's why they feel good. And what's more, _Obra Dinn_ is _strict_ in its simplicity. Every mystery follows the same format: the same three questions, the same three drop-down menus full of possible answers. Sometimes in _Ace Attorney_, a particular detail brought up before a question will link with a detail in the description of some evidence you're holding, and you'll know that it's relevant because of this even if you don't know _why_. The rigidity in _Obra Dinn_ solves this particular problem: by treating every mystery equally, there's no context for you to glean this kind of "meta-knowledge" from.

Figuring out how to apply these insights to a new project is tough, though - even if I was brazen enough to outright copy _Obra Dinn_, its structure only works because it's a game about investigating sixty deaths, and _Hunchback_ isn't.

The leftmost option here is the Cases menu, and it's here where the action in _Hunchback_ is meant to happen. As I've mentioned previously, the Cases menu is meant to look like a classic "conspiracy board": each case is represented by a number of questions, which are written on cards and displayed on the board. To solve the case, the player must dig around in their Evidence drawer and pin the proper evidence to each question. Eventually, I want to bolster the effect with art and animations, so that selecting evidence results in an animation of a photo being physically pinned to the board with a satisfying _thunk_. That sort of tactility will hopefully add a lot of catharsis to deductions.
