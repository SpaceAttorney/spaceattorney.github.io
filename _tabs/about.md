## The Studio
**Intermittent Games** is a one-man game development operation based out of the midwestern United States. They are currently working on _Hunchback_, a deductive adventure game, in Unity.

## The Project
**_Hunchback_** is a top-down adventure game with challenging deductive elements. The player controls Agent Constance, an outsider trapped in the small New England town of Widowlake by a time loop. To escape, Constance must solve a murder, which will necessitate meeting, interviewing, and occasionally solving side cases for each of the town's residents.

For more details, please check the mission statement in [Devlog #0]({% post_url 2022-01-29-hunchback-devlog-0-new-year-new-game %}).

## The Person
**Apogee** (known elsewhere as Space Attorney or BioApple) is a manufacturing associate by night and a mostly self-taught Unity developer, also by night. They have a degree in biomedical engineering and a minor in neuroscience, which they swear they will put to use one day. They have a keen academic interest in art and animation, though one look at the devblog will tell you they have not practiced in either. They read [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) and wish they were smart enough to contribute to its community. Their favorite game is _Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective_.
